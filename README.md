Wind, water and muscle! Primitive vanilla-esque technology without electricity or magic.

Mechanical Tech is a mod that adds primitive technology to Minecraft, based around mechanical power -- water wheels, windmills and manual cranking. It is designed to be simple in use and simple to understand in terms of its implementation. It is also as close to a reference implementation of the [Dynamo API](https://github.com/Eng1N33R/fabric-dynamo-api) as it can be -- a learning exercise in implementing a learning exercise.

[Please consult the wiki](https://github.com/Eng1N33R/MechanicalTech/wiki) to familiarise yourself with the mod's core concepts, crafting recipes and block interactions.
